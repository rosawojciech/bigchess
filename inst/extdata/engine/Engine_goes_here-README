To run the unit tests and examples, you will need a UCI-compatible chess engine capable of running on your hardware. A copy of the engine should be placed in /inst/extdata/engines

For the tests to run properly, this file (Engine_goes_here-README) MUST remain in the directory with the filename UNCHANGED, or the unit tests will fail. Apart from UCI-compatible chess engines, NO OTHER files should be put in this directory, or the unit tests will fail.

If more than one engine is present, only the first will be used. If the engine is not a UCI-compatible chess engine capable of running on your hardware, the unit tests will fail.
