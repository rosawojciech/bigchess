\description{
This function determines whether a specified king is in checkmate. It does
this by first checking if the king is in check, and then verifying if there
are no legal moves left for the king.
}
\details{
The function takes into account the current state of the game and
the color of the king in question. It then checks all possible moves of the
king's pieces to see if any could prevent a checkmate.
}
\examples{
# Initialize a chess board
position <- position.start()
# Check if the white king is in checkmate
is.mate(position, 1)
}
