\description{
This function checks if a king is in check. It does this by checking if any
of the opponent's pieces can move to the square currently occupied by the
king.
}
\details{
The function takes into account the current state of the game and
the color of the king in question. It then checks all possible moves of the
opponent's pieces to see if any could capture the king.
